# webapp-backend
This is the backend for the web application developed for CSYE 7374 course. We have used node.js and express.js to create REST API endpoints for a recipe management system. We are using PostgresQL for the database.

In order to run the application, navigate to the src folder and run "node index.js".

If running the application locally, create a .env file at the root of the project with the following variables

WEBAPP_PORT =<br />
DB_USER =<br />
DB_HOST_NAME =<br />
DB_DATABASE_NAME =<br />
DB_PASSWORD =<br />
DB_PORT =<br />
